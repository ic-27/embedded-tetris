This is an implementation of tetris on the atmega32-16PU microcontroller.  It
features audio (tetris theme song) through a piezoelectric buzzer, VS battle
through bluetooth.

TODO:
- Create a PCB
- Add demonstration video

Setting up Bluetooth:
To set up the bluetooth such that they pair automatically to each other, you
need to first put them AT command mode. This is done by setting the the enable
pin of the HC-05 to a logic high. You should see the LED on the HC-05 blink very
slowly, approximately every 5 seconds. After this upload an arduino with the
sketch ./tools/bluetooth_command.ino and type in the corresponding commands into
the serial monitor of the arduio IDE. If you have an alternative solution to
this, use that. You don't have to have an arduino to do this. It is just that it
is much easier.

_MASTER_
AT+ROLE?
AT+ROLE=1
AT+INQ // Get slave ADDR (slave needs to be on)
AT+BIND=<SLAVE_ADDR> // Put slave ADDR, comma separated

_SLAVE_
AT+ROLE?
AT+ROLE=0
AT+INQ // Get master ADDR (master needs to be on)
AT+BIND=<MASTER_ADDR>

The HC-05 bluetooth module draws approximately 30mA-40mA, so watch out for the
battery life.
