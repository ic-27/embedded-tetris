This is an implementation of tetris on the Atmega32-16PU microcontroller. It
features audio (tetris theme song) through a piezoelectric buzzer, and VS battle
through bluetooth. Please see the tetris_demo.mp4 file for a demonstration.

The Atmega32-16PU microcontroller was programmed using an Arduino ISP. A link to
the tutorial is here:
