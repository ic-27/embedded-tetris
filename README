This is an implementation of tetris on the Atmega32-16PU microcontroller. It
features audio (tetris theme song) through a piezoelectric buzzer, and VS battle
through bluetooth.

The Atmega32-16PU microcontroller was programmed using an Arduino ISP. A link to
the tutorial is here:

TODO:
- Push up the tetris piece of shifting blocks up interferes with original
position
- Automatically set up bluetooth
- Add a start screen
- Create a PCB
- Add demonstration video

Setting up Bluetooth: To set up the bluetooth such that they pair automatically
to each other, you need to first put them AT command mode. This is done by
setting the the enable pin of the HC-05 to a logic high. You should see the LED
on the HC-05 blink very slowly, approximately every 5 seconds. After this upload
an arduino with the sketch ./tools/bluetooth_command.ino and type in the
corresponding commands into the serial monitor of the arduio IDE. If you have an
alternative solution to this, use that. You don't have to have an arduino to do
this. Using the arduino simply makes everything simpler.

_MASTER_
AT+ROLE?
AT+ROLE=1
AT+INQ // Get slave ADDR (slave needs to be on)
AT+BIND=<SLAVE_ADDR> // Put slave ADDR, comma separated

_SLAVE_
AT+ROLE?
AT+ROLE=0
AT+INQ // Get master ADDR (master needs to be on)
AT+BIND=<MASTER_ADDR>

The HC-05 bluetooth module draws approximately 30mA-40mA, so watch out for the
battery life.
